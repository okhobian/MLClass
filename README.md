# MLClass
Introduction to Machine Learning class taught at ISU, Fall 2020 to Spring 2021 [Syllabus](syllabus.md)

All materials, except recorded videos uploaded to Canvas due to privacy concerns, are posted in this repository. 

## Slides 
Slides are made in Markdown source code and compiled into PDFs, webpages, etc.,  using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html)
An example script to convert from Markdown to PDF is [make.sh](make.sh). 

The source files in Markdown are always the latest. 
There maybe delays in PDF syncing. 

**Precompiled PDFs are given below:**

## How to audit (for ISU students only) 

Now students can request to audit a course electronically by going to AccessPlus, clicking on the Student tab, clicking on Registrar Forms, and clicking  "Schedule Change Form". They will need to attach an e-mail from their instructor saying they have permission to audit the course. After attaching documentation, the form can then be routed for approval. 

## Software needed for this class
Feel free to use your personal computer. Be sure to have Python3.6 or later set up, as well as `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` and `tensorflow` 2.x installed. 
Alternatively, you can use the university's infra. See [here](./jupyterhub/howto_students.md).
