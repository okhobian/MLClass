# Homework 1

## Due at 
**Sunday Feb 20, 11:59PM US Central time**

## How to submit: 

Modify the [source code of slides for Unit 1](https://github.com/forrestbao/MLClass/blob/master/1_Introduction/1_intro.md) as instructed below.
Then using `pandoc` to compile your modified Markdown source code into a 4-page (or 5-page if you do the bonus part) deck in PDF format. (Please install `pandoc` on your own system.)
Upload the PDF file to Canvas, under Assignment/HW1. 

Be sure the the PDF file you submit has only 4 or 5 pages. Do NOT submit the Markdown source code. 

There are many documents, videos, tutorials floating around the Internet. Github has [one here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) in particular.  

## Tasks and questions 

1. [2pts] Change the title page or slide 1 of the slide deck. 
   a. Change the second line of the title from "1. Introduction" into "HW1"
   b. Change the author name to your full name. 

2. [4pts] On slide 2, make a list of bullet points where 
      * the first one is Newton's first law of motion, 
      * the second one is  Einstein's mass-energy equation, and 
      * the last one is the time complexity of Quicksort on average in Big-O notation. 
   Then, change the header of slide 2 into "Warm up. "

3. [3 pts] What are the three types of machine learning?  

   Answer this question on slide/page 3. Using bullet points is optional. 

   Leave the slide/page header empty. 

4. [1pt] We now want to build an ML model that predicts the profitability of a retail kiosk in the mall. 
   Because different types of businesses generate cash flows differently, e.g., an coffee kiosk probably makes less money than a one selling smartphones. If we use one-hot encoding to turn kiosk types into binary vectors, and we have 5 categories of kiosks, what is the minimal dimension of the vector? 

   Answer this question on slide/page 4. Leave the slide/page header empty. 

5. [bonus, 5 pts] Compile your deck into an HTML+Javascript slideshow (e.g., in Slideous), set it up on Github.io, and include the URL on the 5th page. Pandoc already supports compiling from Markdown to HTML/JS.
