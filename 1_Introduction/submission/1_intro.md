# Warm up

- Newton's first law of motion: $F=ma$
- Einstein's mass-energy equation: $E=mc^2$
- Time complexity of Quicksort: $O(n\log(n))$

# 

- Supervised Learning 
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning 

# 

- Minimal dimension: $5$
- Reason: we need at least 3 digits in binary to represent 5 types.
